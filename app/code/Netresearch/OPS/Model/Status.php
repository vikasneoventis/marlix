 * OPS response status
 *
 * Statuses in 1 digit are 'normal' statuses:
 *
 * 0 or 1 means the payment entry was not completed either because it is still underway or because interrupted or because
 *   a validation error prevented from confirming. If the cause is a validation error, an additional error code (*) (NCERROR) identifies the error.
 *
 * 2 means the acquirer did not authorise the payment.
 *
 * 5 means the acquirer authorised the payment.
 *
 * 9 means the payment was captured.
 *
 * Statuses in 2 digits corresponds either to  'intermediary' situations or to abnormal events. When the second digit  is:
 *
 * 1, this means the payment processing is on hold.
 *
 * 2, this means an error occurred during the communication with the acquirer. The result is therefore not determined.
 *    You must therefore call the acquirer's helpdesk to find out the actual result of this transaction.
 *
 * 3, this means the payment processing (capture or cancellation) was refused by the acquirer whilst the payment had been authorised beforehand.
 *    It can be due to a technical error or to the expiration of the autorisation. You must therefore call the acquirer's helpdesk to find out the actual result of this transaction.
