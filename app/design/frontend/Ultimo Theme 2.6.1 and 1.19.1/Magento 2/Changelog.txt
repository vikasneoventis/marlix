Version 2.6.1 - September 04, 2017

New:
- choose the number of digits after decimal point for the product label which displays saved amount of money. Useful when you want to show rounded value instead of precise percentage.

Fixed:
- pages with layout "1 column full-width" correctly display the "Preface, Full Width" container
- category page and product page is not empty any more when custom labels are enabled. This could happen if option 
System > Configuration > Theme Settings > Product Labels > "Show Custom Label" was enabled and the custom attribute for labels didn't exist (which was default state in version 2.6.0).


Version 2.6.0 - August 24, 2017

New:
- product labels:
	- label with saved amount: if a product has a special price, the label can be displayed over the product to show the percentage which reflects the saved amount of money, for example: -10%
	- you can create multiple custom labels based on a custom attribute
	- labels have simple rectangular shape and they fade out on mouse hover over the product to show the product image
- featured products slider:
	- display products as thumbnails (small image with name and price displayed at the side of the image)
	- products can be displayed vertically in multiple rows (one below another), you can specify the number of rows
	- new values for the "size" parameter which can change the size of the elements of the slider, such as product name, price
- product page:
	- display related and up-sell products as thumbnails (small image with name and price displayed at the side of the image)
	- thumbnails can be displayed vertically (one below another), you can specify number of rows
	- plus/minus buttons for product quantity on product page
- layered navigation:
	- choose whether filters are collapsed/expanded on page load
	- enable accordion mode (only one filter can be expanded at the same time). If it's disabled, multiple filters can be expanded at the same time.
	- improved display on page load (no flickering) if accordion mode is enabled and all filters are collapsed
- category view:
	- set number of columns (products in a row) individually for each breakpoint
	- product image size in category view can be configured separately for grid mode and for list mode
	- new parameters for the shortcode which can display a block of products similar to the products displayed in category view (in grid or list mode)

Changed:
- when configurable product has special price (i.e. some of its associated simple products have special price), the current price on product page is not marked with red color and doesn't have the "Now Only" label any more.
- product swatches don't have borders

Fixed:
- blocks assigned to "Product View, Primary Column, Container 1" container are displayed in the correct place

If your page had a background image, to restore it after the update you need to reupload the image through admin panel (and then clear the cache).

Fixed:
- restored missing image file (for demo 2): pub/media/wysiwyg/infortis/ultimo/custom/pattern.jpg
